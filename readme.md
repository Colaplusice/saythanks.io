# ‚òº  The 'Say Thanks' Project

## Spreading Thankfulness in Open Source‚Ñ¢

[**saythanks.io**](https://saythanks.io/) will provide a button/link for use by open source projects, to
encourage users to send a simple *thank you* note to the creator (or creators)
of that project.

This simple button/link can be added to READMEs and project documentation.

The author can then enjoy a nice inbox (ideally) filled with very small,
thoughtful messages from the happy users of the software they enjoy to
toil over.

## Implementation Concepts

### ‚ò§ The Basics

- Email when a new message of thankfulness is submitted (csrf enabled).
- Inbox page for each user/project with simple aggregation of messages (private).

### ‚ò§ The Architecture

- Flask for API and Frontend, single application
- Auth0 for credential storage (in progress)
- Heroku for Hosting (done!)
- CloudFlare for SSL termination (done!)
- GitHub account creation, as well as passwordless email accounts

## Intended Collaborators

- Erin "The X" O'Connell (Python)
- Tom "The Pythonist" Baker (Javascript)
- Tom "Sea of Clouds" Matthews (Logo and Graphic Design)
- Kenneth "Your Name Here Instead, Idan?" Reitz (Frontend Design)
